# Non_Mechanical_Anemometer
Currently weâ€™re monitoring weather station parameter such as wind speed and direction using mechanically moving sensors such as cup anemometer and wind vane, problem with such sensors is that they are easy to damage then they are deployed locally.The aim of this project is to find a solution for smart weather station with no mechanical moving parts for measuring all weather conditions with a focus on rain and wind based on low power ML at the edge that can be deployed locally with low cost, low power, reliable, accurate, easy to install and maintain.
# List of Parameters recorded
Wind Velocity and Wind Direction
- Duration measurement
# Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE [Tested]
- Edge Impulse Software [Tested]
- Jupyter Notebook [Tested]
- Google Colab [Tested]
# Sensor
- Transducers salvaged from HCSR04
# Getting started
- Connect the sensor to a microcontroller (Arduino)
- Upload the Data Collection Module script to Arduino  board.
- Once the data collection Completed,Preprocess the data with required timestamp and labels.
- Import the data into Edge Impulse software and Jupyter Notebook
- Data Training
- Impulse Designing
- Model Training
- Performance Evaluation
- Deployment on board Edge module
