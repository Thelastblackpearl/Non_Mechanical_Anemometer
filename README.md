# Non_Mechanical_Anemometer
Currently weâ€™re monitoring weather station parameter such as wind speed and direction using mechanically moving sensors such as cup anemometer and wind vane, problem with such sensors is that they are easy to damage then they are deployed locally.The aim of this project is to find a solution for smart weather station with no mechanical moving parts for measuring all weather conditions with a focus on rain and wind based on low power ML at the edge that can be deployed locally with low cost, low power, reliable, accurate, easy to install and maintain.
